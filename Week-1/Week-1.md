Can take upto 5 also.
In this stage, we need to learn python. And also working with various python libraries. I would suggest that see point 2 videos first to learn python.
Then study resource 3 from hackearth. If then also, you need to know about libraries further, 
Follow links in sub - heading below.

*Happy Learning!!*

**Learn Scientific libraries in Python – NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas**
This is where fun begins! Here is a brief introduction to various libraries. Let’s start practicing some common operations.
Practice the NumPy tutorial thoroughly, especially NumPy arrays. This will form a good foundation for things to come.
Next, look at the SciPy tutorials. Go through the introduction and the basics and do the remaining ones basis your needs.
Finally, let us look at Pandas. Pandas provide DataFrame functionality (like R) for Python. This is also where you should spend good time practicing. Pandas would become the most effective tool for all mid-size data analysis. Start with a short introduction, 10 minutes to pandas. Then move on to a more detailed tutorial on pandas.
